(A) Hyperparameter Optimization  
    - best network topology?
    - how many time steps should one sample contain (SEQ_LEN)?
    - is it better to predict one time step (like implemented) or many?
    - best BATCH_SIZE and number of EPOCHS?
(B) physical model 
    - include and test it with Gazebo model
    - expand SimScape model 
        - script with different test sequences to automate data generation
        - whole model of bearing surface and pillar from the operating table 
    - data augmentation 
(C) live processing with a digital twin
